# DeepDrugDomain

DeepDrugDomain is a comprehensive Python toolkit aimed at simplifying and accelerating the process of drug-target interaction (DTI) and drug-target affinity (DTA) prediction using deep learning. With a flexible preprocessing pipeline and modular design, DeepDrugDomain supports innovative research and development in computational drug discovery.

## Features

- **Extensive Preprocessing Capabilities:** Quickly prepare datasets for modeling with a wide range of built-in preprocessing functions.
- **Modular Design:** Easy-to-use factories for creating models, tasks, collate functions, and more, with just a few lines of code.
- **Stateful Evaluation Metrics:** Integrated evaluation metrics to monitor model performance and ensure reproducibility.
- **Flexible Activation Function Registry:** Register and use custom activation functions seamlessly within models.
- **Comprehensive Task Handling:** Built-in support for common tasks in drug discovery, such as DTI and DTA, with the ability to define custom tasks.

## Installation

```bash
pip install deepdrugdomain
```
## Quick Start
```python
import deepdrugdomain as ddd
